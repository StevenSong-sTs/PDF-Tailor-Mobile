## Interface Design

### Main Screen

### Split Screen
- A button to select the PDF from file system to split
- After the pdf is loaded, It should show the preview of the pdf
- After the pdf is loaded, the `Select File` button should become `Select a new file` button
- The loaded pdf should show the page number at each page
- Each page of the pdf should be able to select and unselected
- The selected page should have a green checkmark icon at the corner and the page should be highlighted
- There should be a button to select all pages and deselect all pages
- There should be a button to export the selected pages as a new PDF
- After the export button is clicked, it should allow user to name the new PDF file
- After the file is exported, it should show the success message
- After the file is exported, the selection should be cleared

### Merge Screen

### Convert Screen
